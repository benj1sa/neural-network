<h1 align="center"> üß† Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network üß† </h1>

A neural network that can be trained to recognize human handwritten characters, a task that is very difficult with traditional approaches to computing.

## Features

The neural network class comes with three simple functions:
* [X] Initialization - Setting the number of input, hidden, and output nodes
* [X] Train - Refine the weights after being given a training set example to learn from
* [X] Query - Give an answer from the output nodes after being given an input
